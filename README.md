## React Todo List

The goal of this exercise is to create a working todo list with some storage.
You can choose to use persistent storage with APIs or to have it facilitated by a JSON file.

## Requirements

1. Clicking on a todo item should toggle the “checked” state.
2. Checked items should sink to the bottom of the list automatically
3. Allow todos to be deleted. When you hover your mouse over a todo, an X should appear on
   the far right side, clicking the X should remove it from the list.

## Stretch Goals

1. Add hidden timestamps to todos (created_at, completed_at), these will be used for sorting
2. The active todos should be sorted by created_at descending
3. The completed todos should be sorted by completed_at ascending
